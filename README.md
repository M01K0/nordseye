Nordseye is a fork of Mkahawa an open-source project that builds on Cafe Con Leche or CCL - the nifty, cross-platform Internet Cafe billing and Management Software started by Bruno Deferrari and Bernard Owour.

Nordseye extends CCL's traditional cross-platform nature, simplicity, lightness and speed with the following major additional features:

Staff Access Management (Login & Logout) <br>
Choice of post-paid and prepaid billing <br>
Stronger membership management <br>
Tickets printing and management <br>
Speed-buttons for simple usage <br>
Installers for Ubuntu, Zencafe(Zenwalk) <br>
Automatic charging for print-outs <br>
Multi-language capability <br>
Client updates from the server <br>
Many more additional features - see full feature list <br>

Nordseye speed and small memory foot-print comes from the fact that it is built in C and C++.

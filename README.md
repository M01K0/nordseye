Choice of post-paid and prepaid billing
Stronger membership management
Tickets printing and management
Speed-buttons for simple usage
Installers for Ubuntu, Zencafe(Zenwalk) and Windows

Nordseye project also aims to provide up-to-date installers for the different Linux distros and Windows versions. (Check this website for add-ons and non-Linux installers).

Nordseye speed and small memory foot-print comes from the fact that it is built in C and C++.

libccl
======

libccl is a library that (tries to) makes the creation
of applications to manage Internet Cafes easier.

It should work anywhere where sqlite, openssl and glib are available.

Dependencies:
* glib-2 (www.gtk.org)
* sqlite-3 (www.sqlite.org)
* openssl (www.openssl.org)

I tested it with glib 2.4.x, and sqlite 3.0.x (older versions of glib
should work too, but sqlite must be >= 3.0), and openssl 0.9.6j.

Installation:
Do the same as always,
  ./configure
  make
and as root,
  make install
